# FonyRunwomanV2
MP3 / WAV player

Fony Runwoman V2 is a C# WPF application that uses the NAudio Library to play MP3's and WAV's.
This is still a WIP not everything fucntions as of yet.
Adding an audio track from a MP3 or WAV file format allows for you to be able to play, pause and stop the track.
Songs are added to a song object witht the name and url.
The songs are then added to a DLL (Doubly linked list) which the contents of that are then to a list box so songs can be selected at will.
